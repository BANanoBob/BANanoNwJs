# BANanoNwJs

Creating desktop applications (Windows, Linux, MacOS) with BANano and NW.js.

## Prerequisites:

[B4J â€“ RAD development tool for cross platform desktop, server and IoT solutions](https://www.b4x.com/b4j.html)

## Getting Started:

* Download NW.js (https://nwjs.io/) and unpack it to a location of your choice.

* Clone this repository or download it as ZIP.

* Copy all files of the folder `Library` into the internal library folder of B4J.

* Open the `BANanoNwJsDemo.b4j` in the folder `Demo` with B4J.

**Important:** Before you start the demo, adjust the variable `NwJsFolder`. Here you have to enter the folder where you unpacked NW.js.

Now you can start the demo. After a short time the NW.js window should open. There are some basic examples of how to control NW.js:

Since NW.js has a' built-in' NodeJS, you can also use appropriate commands (such as those of the filesystem) to communicate from BANano with the 'outside world'.

Just give it a try. :)

Have fun... Peter
